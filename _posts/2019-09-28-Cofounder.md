## **Co-founder for Good Policies**


## **The position**

I am seeking out an altruistic and driven co-founder who is keen to maximise their counterfactual impact by starting high impact charities. I have decided to found a charity with a current focus on tobacco control, advocating to low and middle-income countries to increase tobacco taxes. The [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/tobacco/mpower/raise_taxes/en/) and [Copenhagen Consensus, state](https://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/publication/chronic-disease) that this is the amongst the most cost-effective policies that they are aware of in global health and you can read a summary of Charity Entrepreneurship’s research on tobacco taxation [here](http://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/blog/tobacco-taxation) and GiveWell’s conversation notes where they discuss tobacco taxation [here](https://files.givewell.org/files/conversations/Yolonda_Richardson_12-12-17_(public).pdf).

Our research and cost effectiveness analysis suggests that this is likely to be the most cost-effective policy that has been rigorously examined that mitigates the disease burden of non-communicable diseases. The organisation is amenable to other interventions if a strong case can be made that they are likely to be more cost-effective.


## **Responsibilities**



*   Work closely with the co-founder to shape the vision of the organisation
*   Conduct strong research into effective public health advocacy
*   Work with a co-founder to develop a strong strategy for M&E
*   Build the organisations network with public health experts and value-aligned funders
*   Coordinate with existing advocacy groups and partners to ensure we are using the most effective strategies that we are aware of
*   Work with a co-founder to improve operations by building internal systems
*   Help to manage charity finances including budgeting and grant writing


## **Requirements:**

_An ideal applicant would have most of these things_



*   Passion: Deep enthusiasm about our opportunity to improve people’s lives
*   Perseverance: Dedication to the long-term progress and sustainability of the charity and its intermediate hurdles
*   Creative problem-solving: Ability to efficiently learn and execute best practices where they exist and to innovate where they don’t
*   Managerial and social skills: Ability to lead the team to meet project goals promptly, track progress, foster a positive work environment, and build professional partnerships




## **Desirable Attributes:**

_An ideal applicant **might** have **one** or more of these things_



*   Ability to effectively grasp, critique, and present academic literature that will guide team decisions.
*   Understanding of core Effective Altruism principles
*   The ability to work out of London in the same office as the existing co-founder
*   Desire to travel abroad when necessary
*   Experience managing sizeable budgets
*   Previous experience at a think tank
*   Experience working in South Asia in global health or poverty alleviation
*   Experience in advocacy roles in low and middle-income countries (connections to government would be particularly valuable)
*   Advanced degree (Masters or PhD or equivalent) in economics and an interest in development economics


## **Benefits**



*   Opportunity for highly impactful work whilst building career capital
*   High autonomy and creativity in shaping your role and the development of the charity
*   Pay according to your fit
*   Flexible work environment and schedule
*   Rewarding team environment - this will be meaningful, interesting, and fun!
*   Integration with the effective altruism community
*   Opportunity to travel and speak at conferences
*   Mentoring and support from a network of experienced charity founders and executives
*   Skill development in entrepreneurship, management, and institutional collaboration
*   Working closely with a passionate co-founder deeply interested in these ideas
*   A cause you believe in and a risk worth taking
